# Refactoring

Refactoring code is not only a great chance to expand knowledge but is a way of improving and cleaning up your work. We encourage refactoring code once it's passing all the tests to see if you can elevate it. </br>
The general rule of thumb to follow is red, green, refactor.

- Red refers to tests failing. </br>
- Green refers to tests passing. </br>
- Refactor refers to revisting the passing code and seeing if there's anything you can change.

ðŸ’» **In [refactoring.js](./refactoring.js) we have provided you with some completed kata solutions. Your task is to refactor these solutions with the method suggested above each kata.**

_Make sure the tests are still passing once you are finished! `npm test refactoring.test.js`_

Once you are satisfied that the katas are refactored appropriately, move onto section 8 (Regular Expressions) in the [README](../README.md).
